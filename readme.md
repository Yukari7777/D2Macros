# Destiny 2 AutoHotkey v2 Macro Scripts(D2Macros)

Destiny 2 Macro scripts written in AutoHotkey v2.

Primarily it has been used in personal, working only in my environment. 
But I've decided to publish this scripts for the better compatibility, modularity, stability.

# Features

Currently WIP with upcoming feature :

- More resolution support like 2k, 4k or even the lower with graphical config UI. Currently working only in `1920x1080`.
- Custom keybinding on installation.
- More utility/afk scripts like `afk_rumble`
- Internalization(for Korean)
