# Destiny 2 AutoHotkey v2 Macro Scripts(D2Macros)
Destiny 2 Macro scripts written in AutoHotkey v2.

Primarily it has been used in personal, working only in my environment. \
But I've decided to publish this scripts for the better compatibility, modularity, stability.

# Features
Currently WIP with upcoming feature :
- Documentation with more descriptive expression.
- More resolution support like 2k, 4k or even the lower with graphical config UI. Currently working only in `1920x1080`.
- Custom keybinding with graphical config UI.
- More utility/afk scripts like `afk_rumble`
- Internalization(for Korean)

# How to use?(Installation)
1. Download & install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), Download v2. **You need to install v2**
2. Download this repository as .zip(and unzip it) or clone.
3. Execute main.ahk
4. (temp) Configure keybinds in `config/`. You need to set this manually for now(I'm using `B` key as grenade lol).
5. (temp) Invoke scripts using hard-coded hotkeys. Currently these scripts are supported :
  - `Alt + CapsLock`: Rocket grapple using Strand Subclass
  - `Alt + T`: Air movement skating(Stasis hunter's Shatter dive, Strand hunter's)
  - `Alt + Q`: Super skating(Well skating)
  - `Alt + Numpad1`: Repeative long click macro
  - `Alt + Numpad2`: Repeative long key press macro

Also while the script is active, `Alt+Tab` is a little glitchy. Maybe the hotkey will be changed.
